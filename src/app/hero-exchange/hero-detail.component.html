<p>
  Here we display a sample text through interpolation <b>{{InterpolationText}}</b>
</p>
<p>
    And this is a string bound to the child component by the parent component through 
    property binding and grabbed by the child component using the @Input decorator:
     <b>{{randomMasterCompHero}}</b>
  </p>
<p>
This is a button of which click-event will have an effect, which can be handled by the parent component
<button (click)="onButtonClicked()">Click this button</button>

</p>
